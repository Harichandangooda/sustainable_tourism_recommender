Problem 1: How does the geographical location (latitude/longitude) relate to customer ratings?
For code:Refer comment inside code with "# Using SVR for latitude and longitude v/s rating for "How does the geographical location (latitude/longitude) relate"
For analysis of the question refer section with heading "Explanation and Analysis for SVR for latitude and longitude v/s rating for "How does the geographical location (latitude/longitude) relate to customer ratings?"


Problem 2: Finding/classifying the locations with more daily_avg_popularity during weekdays
For code: Refer comment inside code with " # Using KNN for finding/classifying the locations with more daily_avg_popularity during weekdays"
For analysis of the question refer section with heading "Explanation and Analysis for K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for finding/classifying the locations with more daily_avg_popularity during weekdays"


Team Member 3  
Name: Keshav Narayan Srinivasan  
UBIT: 50610509  
CSV file used:Data.csv
Problem 1:Prediction of Crowd density using Gradient Boosting Regressor
For code:Refer code above "Actual vs. Predicted Crowding Index"
For analysis of the question refer section with heading "EXPLANATION AND ANALYSIS" above Problem 1
Steps to run the code : 
I had run the following libraries in my terminal so kindly add these in yours to run the code: 
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

Problem 2: Clustering Places based on Location and Crowding_Index using DBSCAN (Density based Spacial Clustering)
For code: In [206] in 50610509_Phase2.ipynb
For analysis of the question refer section with heading "EXPLANATION AND ANALYSIS" above Problem 2
