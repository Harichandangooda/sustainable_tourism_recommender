- **Analysis:** Random Forest was used to predict the working hours of tourist spots based on features extracted from popular_times. The model handles high-dimensional data well and can capture complex relationships between visitation trends and working hours.
- **Evaluated Metrics:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.23 hours indicates a reasonably accurate prediction.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 1.23 hours
- **R-Squared (RÂ²):** 0.87
- **Graph**: The bar chart visualizes classification accuracy for each rating category.**

- **Evaluation Metric:** Precision of Recommendations: 95%
- **Average Distance of Nearest Neighbors:** 22.45 km
- **Graph:** The line chart shows the distances to the five closest places for a sample location, indicating their proximity in kilometers.

- **Analysis (Decision Tree Classifier):** A Decision Tree Classifier categorizes locations into 'High', 'Medium', or 'Low' rating categories based on features like location and visitation data. The simple tree structure ensures interpretability.
- **Evaluation Metric:** 
  - **Accuracy:** 80%
  - **Precision (High, Medium, Low):** [0.90, 0.78, 1.00]
  - **Recall (High, Medium, Low):** [0.75, 0.89, 1.00]

- **Evaluation Metric:** 
  - **Overall Accuracy:** 72%
  - **Hourly Classification Accuracy:** Ranges between 65% and 85% depending on the hour
- **Graph:** The line chart illustrates the hourly classification accuracy, showing the model's effectiveness at different times of the day.
