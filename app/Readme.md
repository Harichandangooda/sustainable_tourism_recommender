You can see the video attached in the ublearns submission to understand how our app works and what it does (Since Github restricted files to 20mb we uploaded it in the zip file).

Kindly Note: We have used Google Cloud SQL to store the csv as a table in our PostgreSQL database, so we have not included the Host address and Password in the GitHub code for safety reasons. The UBLearns submission code has the host address and Password included to run the code :)
